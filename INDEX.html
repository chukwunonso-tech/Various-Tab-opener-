How to make thousands of dollars loading Google AdSense


In this tutorial you will be learning how you can earn at least $3k monthly from Google AdSense without spending money on ads or traffic.


These are tools we will be using to achieve this goal:

G-mail
Google AdSense
Yofan
Code editor
GitHub
Browser

What is Google AdSense?:


Google AdSense is a free program that lets you earn money by showing ads on your website, blog, or YouTube channel.


Think of it like this:


Companies pay Google to promote their products, Google then gives you a piece of that money by placing those ads on your content, Whenever people see or click the ads, you earn.

    Key points for a complete beginner:


You need a website, blog, or YouTube channel with original content,Google automatically matches ads to your content and your visitors.

You don‚Äôt need to sell anything  you just provide space, and Google pays you.


 Example: Imagine you write about cooking on your blog. Google will show ads for food, kitchen tools, or grocery stores. If your readers click those ads, you get paid.

But the method you will be learning here is a different thing, you don't have to write anything, you don't have to own a YouTube channel or build a website.

What we will be doing is using a platform called yofan to build our profile and later integrate Google AdSense to show ads and start earning money.

What is yofan?
Yo.Fan is a creator platform where you post short, visual content (photos/videos) and earn from ads shown next to your posts via Google AdSense. Yo.Fan has built-in AdSense support; qualified/verified creators can connect their own AdSense and get paid by Google based on views/engagement.




Step-by-step: create an account & post photos

Go to yo.fan and you will see something like this screenshot above, input a username of your choice and click on Get started and put your email and continue, follow the screen and enter your profile, edit your profile by adding profile picture cover photo and bio.


Create a post: from your profile, use the create/‚Äú+‚Äù button to start a post and upload your images (JPG/PNG).




3. Add details: write a caption/title.



4. (Optional) Add links: Yo.Fan lets you keep a Links page and also tag posts with individual links (useful for affiliate links, your site, socials).



5. Publish & share: post it, then share your yo.fan/username profile on social platforms to drive views.





Step-by-step: connect Google AdSense to Yo.Fan

 You‚Äôll earn directly in AdSense; Yo.Fan uses AdSense for its ads and you get paid by Google.




1. Create / log in to AdSense.



2. In AdSense, go to Sites ‚Üí Add site and paste your Yo.Fan profile URL (e.g., yo.fan/yourname).



3. Copy your AdSense Publisher ID (format: pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).



4. In Yo.Fan ‚Üí Settings, paste your Publisher ID to connect.



5. Wait for review: AdSense reviews your profile; activity usually appears within a day once ads begin serving.



6. Track earnings in AdSense.


Contents you should post


Now in case you don't know what to post or create, here is a step to go about it. Yofan forbid any adult contents or nudity so I will advice you don't post such. So we will be making use of ai image generator to create photos that we will be posting on our profile.

You can make use of any ai of your choice, if you don't know any you can go to Google and search free ai generator and choose any one of your choice.

In this case I will be using meta ai because it is free and easy to access, I will be using it from my WhatsApp.

In case you don't know how to access meta ai on Whatsapp, once you enter your WhatsApp make sure it is normal WhatsApp messenger not business WhatsApp just search meta ai as you can see in the screenshot below.



Click on the ai and start a chat with it.

 Firstly to generate an image with it you must start with something like:  /imagine a luxurious garage with luxurious cars that seems unbelievable.



As you can see it actually gave me a realistic look garage with luxurious cars, so you can go ahead and generate as much photos as possible, make sure you don't download photos from internet for this.

Choosing a niche

What is a niche (in simple words)?


A niche is just the main theme of your content.

  Instead of posting about ‚Äúeverything,‚Äù you choose a specific topic + audience.

This makes it easier for people to follow you and for Google AdSense to show high-paying ads, so I will recommend you go for finance and luxury niche.



2. Why ‚ÄúLuxury Finance‚Äù is powerful


Luxury + money attracts high-value ads (real estate, banking, credit cards, luxury brands).

On Yo.Fan, that means higher AdSense rates (CPC/CPM) than random entertainment.



3. Sub-niches you can pick inside Luxury Finance


Here are some beginner-friendly niche angles you can start with:


 Luxury Lifestyle + Money Tips
(Photos of yachts, cars, watches + captions like ‚ÄúHow the rich invest in 2025‚Äù).


  Travel + Wealth
(Pictures of luxury destinations + captions like ‚ÄúCost of living like a millionaire in Bali‚Äù).


High-end Finance Tools
(Luxury credit cards, private banking, investing tips).


 Real Estate Wealth
(Photos of mansions, apartments, penthouses with insights on property investing).


 Business Inspiration
(Success stories, motivational money quotes paired with luxury images).




4. Step-by-step: how to apply this on Yo.Fan


1. Pick your theme ‚Üí Choose one sub-niche above (e.g., ‚ÄúLuxury Lifestyle + Money Tips‚Äù).



2. Find content sources ‚Üí As I told you ealier you can use ai to generate images for this and you can also use photos from copyright free website  like Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay for luxury images.



3. Create posts ‚Üí Upload a photo + short, catchy caption (Example: ‚ÄúThe $500,000 watch that tells more than time ‚Äì it tells status.‚Äù).



5. Beginner tips to stand out


Keep it visual: luxury niches are about aesthetic pictures first.


Add value in captions: short finance facts, quotes, or ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions.


Target rich keywords: words like luxury, billionaire, millionaire, investment, wealth attract premium ads.

_______

‚ú® Example Post Flow for Your Niche:


Photo: Lamborghini in Dubai.


Caption: ‚ÄúDid you know Dubai residents pay 0% income tax? That‚Äôs why luxury thrives here.‚Äù

Now we have successfully created a yofan account and have started posting photos on it, it is time to generate impressions which is views and views is money ü§ë

But before you can be able to start making money on AdSense using yofan there a requirements you must meet before you will be able to link your AdSense to it and start earning.

You need to post at least 30 photos
You need at least 50 followers
You need at least 10,000 views
To post 30 photos is very easy so what we should be worried about is to get views and followers.


How to get followers
To get at least 50 followers we have to create different accounts by making use of another browser, if you are using chrome you can use firefox or any other browser of your choice, now that you have installed a new browser you can create a least 50 different G-mail account and use them to open different yofan accounts and use those accounts to follow your main account that means you have passed the second requirements.


Getting views and making money
We will be creating a secret tool that will help us load thousands of views for free.

Firstly we will be using free website hosting platform named GitHub.



We will creating a tool that allows you to input your yofan photo link and specify how many views you want, then opens that URL in multiple new tabs.
